            <h1>Franz Kafka</h1>
            <h2>Novelist and writer</h2>
            <p>Franz Kafka (3 July 1883 – 3 June 1924) was a German-language novelist and writer from Prague. 
                He is widely regarded as a major figure of 20th-century literature. His work fuses elements of realism and the fantastic. 
                It typically features isolated protagonists facing bizarre or surrealistic predicaments and incomprehensible socio-bureaucratic powers. 
                It has been interpreted as exploring themes of alienation, existential anxiety, guilt, and absurdity.</p>
